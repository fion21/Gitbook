### ReactJS app to search Github profiles
[Live site](https://gitbook-react.herokuapp.com)

This search profile app uses the `Context API` and the `useContext` and `useReducer` hooks for state management inspired by "React Front To Back" Brad Traversy Course.

## UI/UX
This mimics the function of searching for a profile, such as can be found on Facebook, Linkedin or Instagram. Here is this feature for Gihub's handle.
